# disframe
A modular and extensible Discord bot framework that allows easy customization by adding new commands through Python cogs.

## Features

- **Modular Command Structure**: Add new commands by creating Python files in the `cmds` directory.
- **Role-based Permissions**: Commands can be restricted to specific roles like `mod`, `dev`, or `user`.
- **Automatic Role Creation**: The bot will automatically create `dev`, `mod`, and `user` roles if they do not exist.
- **Message Deletion Command**: Clear a specified number of messages (10-100) with one simple command.
- **Self-Deleting Messages**: Error and success messages delete themselves after a specified time.
- **DM Disabled**: The bot does not respond to direct messages, ensuring it only works in servers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Discord.py (installed via `pip install discord.py`)
- A Discord bot token

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-bot.git
cd discord-bot
```
### 2. Install dependencies
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your bot token
Create a config.py file in the root directory and add your Discord bot token:

```python
# config.py
TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```
Replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" with your actual Discord bot token.

### 4. Run the bot
Once everything is set up, run the bot using:

```bash
python bot.py
```
The bot will log in and start processing commands.

# Adding Commands
To add new commands, simply follow these steps:

Create a Python file in the cmds folder (e.g., `new_command.py`).
Define a class inheriting from `commands.Cog` and add the new commands inside that class.
Use the `@commands.command()` decorator to define the command.
Implement any logic or checks for role-based permissions.
Example of where i would place my custom command (`cmds/new_command.py`):

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

class NewCommand(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.command(name="newcommand")
    @commands.has_role("mod")
    async def new_command(self, ctx):
        await ctx.send("This is a new command for moderators.")

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(NewCommand(bot))
```
### Loading the Command
The bot will automatically load any new commands placed in the cmds folder when it starts. Just create the new file, and you're good to go.

#### Bot Permissions
Admin/Owner Role: This role has unrestricted access to all commands.
Mod Role: This role has access to specific commands such as clearing messages.
User Role: Regular users have limited access to certain commands.
